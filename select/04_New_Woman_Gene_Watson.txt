I was along neckin' with the boys at the local hot spot
In the midst of celebratin' this newfound freedom I've got
They ain't call them walking papers wasn't even right
So when she brought 'em here tonight
I was expecting to see that same dang doe tears bounce

But she's a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hand
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man

How did she go from stone cold to red hot, open tonight
All this honey she is pourin', she must have kept bottled all the time
'Cause heaven knows that I can't believe, that little devil's my used to be
This might be fair play, boys but she ain't playin' right

She's a looking like a new woman
She is in neon light
She's gone from every day square
To party hardy, wild thing, overnight

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
Sleek blond with a faking big ten
Sure hits a bad time for me to be her actual man

She's emptying every barstool, got the boys formed in a line
I think I'll slip on back 'cause I cant take the sight

But her a looking like a new woman
My, would you look at that dress
Every eye is on her
She is a walking, talking, little miss confident

Yeah, she's a looking like a new woman
She's got my buddies in the palm of her hands
And it's a hell of a time for me to be her actual man
She picked a hell of a time for me to be her actual man
