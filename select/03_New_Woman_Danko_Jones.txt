I thought the sun wouldn't shine no more
I was looking out for a better day
Yeah, I was sore when you kicked me out the door
But I wouldn't have it any other way

I can feel the winds of change
Cut and paste and re-arrange
Gonna find myself a brand new woman
10 times better than you

I can't believe what you put me through
You had a smile and I was black and blue
You don't want me that's OK
A new woman's gonna make my day
